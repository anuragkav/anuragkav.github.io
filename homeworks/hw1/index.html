        <p> Article Responses:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Something I learned form this article that I should start seeing design in everyday life. For example, looking for negative and positive space in everyday things
                and opening up apps on my phone to study their design.
                 </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this article was how short and to the point it was in delivering its message. The author didnt
                waste any time in telling the readers exactly what to do to develop the product thinking.</li>
            <li>Compelling Quote: "y routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
